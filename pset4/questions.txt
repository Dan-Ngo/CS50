0.  How many different colors does each format support?
        JPEG - 16.7 million colors
        BMP - 4.29 billion colors
        GIF - 256 colors
        PNG - 256 to 16.7 million colors
1.  Which of the formats supports animation?
        GIF supports animation
2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
        lossy compression reduces the file size at expense of image
        quality.  Lossless keeps all image information and is therefore
        bigger in file size.
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
        JPG
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
        The data pointing to that file is erased but the file itself is kept intact
        until either written over or restored.
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
        Destroy the hard drive or overwrite all data on the hard drive
6.  What’s stdint.h?
        stdint.h defines the maximum and minimum allowable values in the form of macros.
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
        In order to specify the exact size of uint or int
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
        BYTE = 8 / 8 = 1
        DWORD = 32 / 8 = 4
        LONG = 32 / 8 = 4
        WORD = 16 / 8 = 2
9. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes 
   used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers.)"
        BM in ASCII
10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
        bfSize - the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file
        biSize - the number of bytes required by the bitmap header
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
        a negative indicates a top down device independent bitmap where the origin is top left
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
        biBitCount
13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
        It will return null if outfile specified is already created and is read only... 
        If the file doesn't exist, the file will be created so this will not return null
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
        It specifies number of elements read and the only element read is one BITMAPFILEHEADER
        which is a struct
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
        padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
        The padding is equal to 3 because
        (4 - (3 * 3 % 4)) % 4 evaluates to a 3
16. What does fseek do?
        fseek(inptr, padding, SEEK_CUR);
        fseek moves the file pointer by the "padding" amount from the SEEK_CUR (current
        position of the file pointer))
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
        SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer
